# Circadian Sensitivity 

## TODO 

* initial conditions for regular light on the limit cycle 
* overall Sensitivity as a function of light schedule type (regular, shiftwork, jetlag) 
* overall sensitivity as a function of light intensity within the same light schedule 
* power spectrum as a function of schedule and density 
* What components make up the dominant eigenvector 
* Run for real world light schedules
